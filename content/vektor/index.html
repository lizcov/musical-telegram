                    <p>Context: 
                        <br/>My main stakeholder was the CEO of an engineering consulting company in the highly regulate Commissioning, Qualification, and Validation space. 
                        The main stakeholer goals were to improve an in-house product that they had developed as inustry experts with software engineers and were now piloting with external users as a SaaS product with high revenue potential.
                        <br/>My UX/UI specific tasks were to make it <b>"pretty"</b>, a more intuitive user experience, and help build out the increased amount of new modules and features.
                        <br/>My role was multi-disciplinary across the company which gave me industry context and exposure to business development strategy allowing me to see more clearly the ties between improving UX/UI and overall business development goals.
                        This exposure and ability to work with the CEO allowed me to understnad how the primary stakeholder viewed the application and it's progress.

                        <br/>My initial hypothesis: we will improve based on UX research and build our designs upon a wealth of knowlege.
                        <br/>The reality: The motivation and perceived business value of UXR was low due to a variety of factors. I began ideating, sketching, and creating mockups before having a full understanding of the product and the industry due to urgent business needs.
                        <br/>I realized I would have essentially no basis of product specific UXR to build off of and I will be working on UX/UI while I learn the industry and application.
                        <br/>Updated hypothesis/goal: to improve the application in terms of usability and aesthetics by independent research, in-house trainings, and any opportunity to get feedback.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8"> <!-- Updated text-gray-700 to text-gray-800 -->
                Given the constraints of a niche B2B product and limited access to the target user base, I approached design with a resourceful, agile, and highly collaborative mindset.
                <br/>My process was a rapid loop of briefs and research wherever possible, ideate, design solution(s), review with collaborators, repeat previous steps if needed, and ship.
                <br/> <b>Main Challenge</b>
                <br/>Most solutions were urgent, same day deliverables in response to a key user friction point or business evelopment blocker. This meant frequent meetings between the lead developer and myself to brief, review designs, update, and hand off.
                <br/>In some cases, there were larger more complex features that were eveloped over many months such as a complex dashboard screen that had hundreds of iterations with new sub-features, dashboards, and forms within. 
                <br/>For longer term deliverables, the process was the same except with added space for more research and occasional user calls, trainings, and more formal feedback sessions.

                <p>The redesign achieved its core goals. By making the application aesthetically superior and consistently usable, we successfully onboarded <b>all internal users</b> to critical weekly functions (Timesheets and Expense reporting), proving Vektor’s value and providing a massive, built-in feedback loop.</p>

                <p>Success in this environment required being a <b>strategic generalist</b>—a designer who could pivot priorities, balance multiple ongoing projects/deliverables, and drive the overall commercial narrative. 
                    I would say this area is my biggest area for growth and going back I would have taken more ownership and approached marketing materials from a UX perspective sooner than I did and created more MVPs.

                <p>This project was a significant accelerator for my professional growth. Moving from working with a two-person design team to a larger, complex team and into a leadership role within the first 3 months taught me the importance of adaptibility and emphasis on systems rather than one-off solutions. For example, focusing on a <b>design system</b> not just for consistency, but as a communication tool to maintain velocity across multiple developers will provide value long after I am gone.</p>
                <p>My key learnings centered on the <b>business-UX relationship</b>. I gained a deep appreciation for how understanding CEO goals directly translates into prioritizing which features to build first (e.g., Timesheets for adoption over complex niche tools). Crucially, I learned that <b>system thinking</b> applies everywhere. Building solid, repeatable business processes (like improving budget reviews) first made it infinitely easier to translate those requirements into the app, improving the end-user experience.</p>
                <p>Finally, I grew in <b>confidence</b>. Early on, I wish I would have been more assertive in both owning what I knew and clearly articulating what I didn't. This experience taught me to recognize the value of my unique position and expertise, making me a more effective and decisive lead designer.</p>
