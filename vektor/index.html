                    <p>The primary mandate was to take a powerful, in-house enterprise tool—built by industry experts—and dramatically improve its aesthetics and user experience. My CEO stakeholder wanted Vektor to be **"pretty"** and intuitive enough to be successfully launched as a commercial SaaS product.</p>

                    <p>Unlike typical projects, formal UX research was low priority. Recognizing that the app's functionality was already superior to competitors, I made a **strategic pivot**: my goal shifted from rigorous UXR to **prioritizing aesthetic quality and structural consistency** to solve the #1 business priority: **user adoption**. Success hinged on my ability to be a design system architect, a proxy user, and a highly agile dev partner.</p>

                            Before jumping into high-fidelity mockups, I collaborated with another designer to explore a range of solutions through quick, iterative sketching sessions. This process allowed us to rapidly ideate, align on a shared vision, and solve complex layout challenges on paper before committing to digital wireframes. This early-stage collaboration was key to building a robust foundation for the rest of the design process.

                            I quickly moved from high-level requirements directly into high-fidelity mockups in Figma. This approach was a strategic response to a lean, fast-paced environment where the development team worked in two-week sprints and in response to urgent client needs. I was able to deliver features with a same-day or 24-hour turnaround to meet the development team's needs in certain scenarios to ensure new designs and fixes maintained the product's quality and consistency allowing developers to focus solely on functionality.

                            In light of lack of access to formal user testing, I prioritized an iterative feedback loop with key internal stakeholders, including the lead developer and in-house project managers. This constant communication was critical for problem-solving technical limitations, ensuring a smooth handoff, and providing a unified approach to the product's development. My role was not just to design but to be a strategic partner who got things done and could translate complex data sets into accessible cloud / digital solutions.

                <p>This project was a significant accelerator for my professional growth. Moving from working with a two-person development team to a larger, complex team taught me the importance of a **bulletproof design system** not just for consistency, but as a communication tool to maintain velocity across multiple developers.</p>
                <p>My key learnings centered on the **business-UX relationship**. I gained a deep appreciation for how understanding CEO goals directly translates into prioritizing which features to build first (e.g., Timesheets for adoption over complex niche tools). Crucially, I learned that **system thinking** applies everywhere. Building solid, repeatable business processes (like expense reporting) first made it infinitely easier to translate those requirements into the app, improving the end-user experience.</p>
                <p>Finally, I grew in **confidence**. Early on, I wish I would have been more assertive in both owning what I knew and clearly articulating what I didn't. This experience taught me to recognize the value of my unique position and expertise, making me a more effective and decisive lead designer.</p>
