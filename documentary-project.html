                        This project served as my Master of Science thesis at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I chose to address vehicle dwelling and its perception as a lifestyle in the Americas, and the vulnerabilities different populations encounter as vehicle dwellers. The chosen medium was a documentary, which allowed for a compelling and empathetic narrative.

        <section class="mb-16">
            <h2 class="section-header">The Challenge</h2>
            <p class="text-lg">In 2020, media portrayals of vehicle dwelling began popping up all over social media as a result of the pandemic. Social media influencers often focus on "freedom" and the desirability of this lifestyle, while the award-winning film *Nomadland* showed a very different side of the vehicle-dwelling community. This project's goal was to go beyond these portrayals to understand the lived experiences and underlying motivations of people who choose this lifestyle. I wanted to understand the pain points of conventional dwelling that lead people to this solution and highlight the factors beyond it being "trendy." Real people feel they have no other choice, but they are penalized for being in an already vulnerable situation, and I wanted to give them a voice.</p>

        <!-- My Approach Section -->
        <section class="mb-16">
            <h2 class="section-header">My Approach</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">I used a qualitative UX research approach to gain a nuanced understanding of the community. My research focused on:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Understanding the "Why":</span> I wanted to understand the deeper struggles with conventional living that lead people to this alternative lifestyle.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Qualitative Research:</span> I spoke directly with individuals in the vehicle dwelling community to get beyond media stereotypes and understand their authentic stories as well as experts who could provide a systemic level of understanding.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Quantitative Research:</span> I researched news articles, publications, and did a literature review to get a better picture of the actual number of people being affected and demographic insights.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Key Findings Section -->
        <section class="mb-16">
            <h2 class="section-header">Key Findings</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">The narrative of vehicle dwelling is far more complex and nuanced than popular culture suggests. My key findings were:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Diverse Motivations:</span> The reasons for choosing this lifestyle are wide-ranging. For some, it is a deliberate choice for freedom, and they have the resources to make it a sustainable, adventurous life. For others, it is the only viable solution to economic struggles, and their decision is rooted in a lack of choice and freedom.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Invisible Struggles:</span> Vehicle dwellers are often penalized for being in an already vulnerable situation. My work highlighted the hidden challenges and systemic pain points that are often overlooked, focusing on the human impact of these struggles.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">A Shift in Perspective:</span> Through the extensive research, this project helped me gain a deeper understanding of a community's daily world and reframed vehicle dwelling beyond what social media reveals.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- The Outcome Section -->
        <section class="mb-16">
            <h2 class="section-header">The Outcome</h2>
            <p class="text-lg">The result of this research was a documentary that challenged assumptions and brought authentic voices to the forefront. It served as a powerful tool to share the findings and highlight the a-linear motivations and complex struggles of the vehicle-dwelling community. The ultimate "deliverable" was not a product, but a deeper understanding and empathy for a user demographic.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Moving Forward</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">The insights from this research can serve as a foundation for future work and impact. The key findings provide a solid basis to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Inform Policy and Initiatives:</span> The research can guide policymakers and non-profits in developing more effective housing initiatives and social support programs that address the specific needs of vulnerable populations.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Guide Inclusive Design:</span> City planners and urban designers can use this information to create more welcoming and supportive urban spaces, such as designated parking areas or accessible public services, that accommodate the realities of vehicle dwelling.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Shape Product and Service Development:</span> Companies can use this understanding to build products and services that genuinely empower this community, moving beyond superficial trends to address real-world pain points affecting an untapped market looking for cost effective and simple solutions.</li>
            </ul>
