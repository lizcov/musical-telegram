            <p class="text-lg">The primary challenge was to take a pre-existing enterprise application, designed for a niche audience, and transform it. The application was highly functional, but its interface was dated and lacked consistency and a modern feel. The complexity of the information and the highly regulated nature of the work—from project management to human resources and payroll—demanded a solution that was not only robust but also intuitive. The goal was to create a cohesive, user-friendly experience that allowed users to easily navigate complex workflows, manage a wide range of tasks, and feel confident in the application's ability to handle their critical data with precision.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-8">The product, Vektor, was already in development when I joined. My challenge was to transform a pre-existing platform into a truly intuitive and efficient tool. Given the constraints of a niche B2B product and limited access to the target user base, I approached design with a resourceful, agile, and highly collaborative mindset.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">My process was grounded in extensive academic and market research. I delved into academic papers and case studies to understand the needs of our target users and the industry. This foundational knowledge informed my design decisions and marketing messaging, ensuring my work was strategically sound even without direct user access.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">I quickly moved from high-level requirements directly into high-fidelity mockups in Figma. This approach was a strategic response to a lean, fast-paced environment where the development team worked in two-week sprints. I was able to deliver features with a same-day or 24-hour turnaround to ensure designs were implemented by a designer, not the developers, which was critical for maintaining the product's quality and consistency.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Instead of formal user testing, I prioritized an iterative feedback loop with key internal stakeholders, including the lead developer and in-house project managers. This constant communication was critical for problem-solving technical limitations, ensuring a smooth handoff, and providing a unified approach to the product's development. My role was not just to design but to be a strategic partner who got things done.</p>

                My work on the Vektor platform focused on redesigning a range of key features to improve usability and team collaboration. While a significant portion of my time was dedicated to a complex, multi-page overview dashboard, I will highlight the redesigned login and landing page to showcase my approach to visual design and user flow.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        The redesigned login and landing page was an important first step in modernizing the user experience. My goal was to simplify the interface, improve visual clarity, and create a more intuitive entry point for users. This included a visual refresh that aligned with a new design system and a focus on reducing friction to get users into the application quickly.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        When I joined Dynamixe, a design system had been initiated by a previous UI designer. After they left, I became the sole/lead UX/UI designer and was responsible for not only contributing to the product but also for building out the design system itself. This included creating new components, defining design tokens, and ensuring consistency across the platform. This work was critical in establishing a scalable and efficient design workflow for the company.

            <p class="text-lg">
                The redesigned overview page and its sub-features were successfully launched and integrated into the Vektor product. The new digital-first workflow improved team collaboration and provided a single source of truth for all project information. By making the process transparent and streamlined, we helped teams work more efficiently and reduce the delays inherent in legacy, paper-based systems.
