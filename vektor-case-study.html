            <p class="text-lg">
                In highly regulated industries like pharmaceutical manufacturing, the document review and approval process for equipment validation (CQV/CSV) was heavily reliant on outdated, manual methods. This paper and email-based workflow led to significant delays, a lack of transparency, and limited collaboration. Project managers and team members struggled to get a real-time, unified view of a project's status, often resorting to creating their own spreadsheets just to keep track.

            <p class="text-lg mb-8">
                The product, Vektor, was already in development when I joined. My challenge was to take a pre-existing platform and, through redesign and new feature development, transform it into a truly intuitive and efficient tool. My approach was both iterative and collaborative.

                            Given the constraints of working with a niche, B2B product and limited direct user access, I employed guerrilla user research. I conducted informal interviews and testing with an internal stakeholder and used tools like UXtweak to gather feedback, which was crucial for identifying pain points and informing my design decisions.

                            I translated user requirements into low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity mockups in Figma. I held regular review sessions with the lead developer to test concepts, problem-solve technical limitations, and ensure a smooth handoff. This tight feedback loop was critical to the success of the new features.

            <p class="text-lg mb-8">
                My work on the Vektor platform focused on redesigning a range of key features to improve usability and team collaboration. While a significant portion of my time was dedicated to a complex, multi-page overview dashboard, I will highlight the redesigned login and landing page to showcase my approach to visual design and user flow.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        The redesigned login and landing page was an important first step in modernizing the user experience. My goal was to simplify the interface, improve visual clarity, and create a more intuitive entry point for users. This included a visual refresh that aligned with a new design system and a focus on reducing friction to get users into the application quickly.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        When I joined Dynamixe, a design system had been initiated by a previous UI designer. After they left, I became the sole/lead UX/UI designer and was responsible for not only contributing to the product but also for building out the design system itself. This included creating new components, defining design tokens, and ensuring consistency across the platform. This work was critical in establishing a scalable and efficient design workflow for the company.

            <p class="text-lg">
                The redesigned overview page and its sub-features were successfully launched and integrated into the Vektor product. The new digital-first workflow improved team collaboration and provided a single source of truth for all project information. By making the process transparent and streamlined, we helped teams work more efficiently and reduce the delays inherent in legacy, paper-based systems.
