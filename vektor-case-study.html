            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                The primary challenge was to take a pre-existing enterprise application, designed for a niche audience, and transform it. The application was highly functional, but its interface was dated and lacked consistency and a modern feel. The complexity of the information and the highly regulated nature of the work—from project management to human resources and payroll—demanded a solution that was not only robust but also intuitive. The goal was to create a cohesive, user-friendly experience that allowed users to easily navigate complex workflows, manage a wide range of tasks, and feel confident in the application's ability to handle their critical data with precision.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                The product, Vektor, was already in development when I joined. My challenge was to transform a pre-existing platform into a truly intuitive and efficient tool. Given the constraints of a niche B2B product and limited access to the target user base, I approached design with a resourceful, agile, and highly collaborative mindset.

                            My process was grounded in extensive academic and market research. I delved into academic papers and case studies to understand the needs of our target users and the industry. This foundational knowledge informed my design decisions and marketing messaging, ensuring my work was strategically sound even without direct user access.

                            Before jumping into high-fidelity mockups, I collaborated with another designer to explore a range of solutions through quick, iterative sketching sessions. This process allowed us to rapidly ideate, align on a shared vision, and solve complex layout challenges on paper before committing to digital wireframes. This early-stage collaboration was key to building a robust foundation for the rest of the design process.

                            I quickly moved from high-level requirements directly into high-fidelity mockups in Figma. This approach was a strategic response to a lean, fast-paced environment where the development team worked in two-week sprints. I was able to deliver features with a same-day or 24-hour turnaround to ensure designs were implemented by a designer, not the developers, which was critical for maintaining the product's quality and consistency.

                            Instead of formal user testing, I prioritized an iterative feedback loop with key internal stakeholders, including the lead developer and in-house project managers. This constant communication was critical for problem-solving technical limitations, ensuring a smooth handoff, and providing a unified approach to the product's development. My role was not just to design but to be a strategic partner who got things done.

                My work on the Vektor platform focused on redesigning a range of key features to improve usability and team collaboration.

                    The redesigned login and landing page was an important first step in modernizing the user experience.

This included a visual refresh that aligned with a new design system and a focus on reducing friction to get users into the application quickly.

After they left, I became the sole/lead UX/UI designer and was responsible for not only contributing to the product but also for building out the design system itself. This included creating new components, defining design tokens, and ensuring consistency across the platform. This work was critical in establishing a scalable and efficient design workflow for the company.
